# Research Data and Pipe Management System (RDPMS)

RDPMS is a project that follows a twofold approach: (1) it may store and process data that was collected especially in robotics and autonomous driving context and (2) may supports sharing and tracking (for legal compliance reasons) of data across multiple instances.

More information can be found in [our proposal](./docs/radtke-proposal-distributed-rdm-system-2024.pdf) for the [RDMxSE workshop](https://nfdixcs.org/event/working-workshop-on-research-data-management-for-and-in-software-engineering-rdmxse%EF%BB%BF). 

## List of requirements and potentially planned features

Remarks
- The current list does not include any requirements related to sharing data.
- "FSD" refers to a project and concepts by a group of Formula Student teams: ETH ZÃ¼rich, TU Hamburg, KIT, NTNU Trondheim, Uni Bayreuth, and TU Dortmund.
